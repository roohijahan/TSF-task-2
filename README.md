# TSF-task-2
The task involves clustering the Iris dataset, consisting of sepal and petal measurements, using the K-Means algorithm. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method, and the clusters are visualized in 2D space using PCA. The visualization highlights the natural groupings of the dataset and the centroids of the clusters.
